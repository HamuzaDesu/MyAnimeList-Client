# MyAnimeList Client

Just a flask app I'm making to manage my anime list on [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/)

----
For now it uses OAuth2 to log into your MyAnimeList account and currently displays user information (only name and profile picture) and the first 1000 items in a users anime list. It runs using flask sessions so users can login and have their data persist over sessions. Also, there is an option to log out.

I will add more to this in time c:
